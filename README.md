## Issues Encountered

***

I had issues selecting the multiple images for lightening opacity on hover.

I tried using getElementsByClassName, querySelectorAll, and getElementById to select the gallery and then using .children to target specific divs, but none of them responded. I was able to get these to work when i selected the IDs and called them individually, but this made my code very long. I went back to class work/homework and tried a loop and it worked fine, but I'm still not sure why I couldn't get the divs to select any other way.

## Outside Sources

I didn't use any outside sources. The hamburger menu was pulled from last semester and reference link was provided in hw 1 & 3.
